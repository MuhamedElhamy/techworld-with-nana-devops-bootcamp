# 01 - Introduction to DevOps

In traditional software development, the process is segmented into distinct roles: **Development**, **Software Testing**, and **Operations**.

- **Software Development**: Involves building applications, deploying them on servers, upgrading existing software, and running it in production. This phase is typically handled by developers using programming languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript to introduce new functionalities and bug fixes.
  
- **Software Testing**: Ensures that new features work as intended and that existing functionality remains stable. This can be done manually or through automated testing by developers and dedicated testers.

- **Operations**: Responsible for deploying software, maintaining its stability in production, and ensuring that systems are up and running efficiently. 

### Traditional Development vs. Operations

In traditional models, **Development** and **Operations** have different focuses and responsibilities:

- **Development**: Focuses on implementing new features quickly using programming languages, test frameworks, databases, and version control.
- **Operations**: Prioritizes maintaining system stability, requiring technical knowledge of OS (primarily Linux), command-line scripting, and monitoring tools.

#### Challenges:

- **Miscommunication & Lack of Collaboration**: The division between Development and Operations often leads to silos, where poor communication can cause deployment issues, especially when environments need to be configured correctly.
  
- **Conflict of Interest**: Development teams are pressured to release new features quickly, while Operations teams focus on system stability. This results in manual work, checklists, and deployment configurations, which slow down the release process.

**DevOps** emerged as a solution to bridge the gap between Development and Operations, aiming to eliminate roadblocks and inefficiencies in the release process.

### Simplified Definitions:

- **Intersection of Development & Operations**: DevOps combines both roles to create a more efficient, streamlined workflow.
  
- **Continuous Delivery**: DevOps is centered on making the process of continuous delivery faster and more reliable, with minimal errors.

### Implementation:

- **Common Language & Collaboration**: DevOps introduces a common language and workflow between Developers (DEV) and Operations (OPS) teams, reducing miscommunication and fostering collaboration.

- **Streamlined Processes**: Instead of manual, inefficient tasks, DevOps emphasizes automation and integration, helping to accelerate the release cycle.

### DevOps Culture Evolution:

- Different companies have adopted DevOps in various ways, but it has evolved into a more concrete practice with common patterns such as:
  - **Planning & Collaboration**: DevOps encourages cross-functional teams to work together from the planning stages to implementation.
  - **Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)**: The core of DevOps, CI/CD automates the integration of code changes and their deployment to production.
  - **Treat Infrastructure as Code**: Using tools like Terraform, infrastructure is managed through code, allowing for consistent, repeatable environments.
  - **Container Orchestration**: Technologies like Docker and Kubernetes enable scalable, portable environments for application deployment.

### DevOps as a Role:

- DevOps has evolved into a dedicated role: **DevOps Engineer**. These professionals are responsible for creating and maintaining the automated processes that support continuous delivery, integrating tools and practices across Development and Operations.

**DevOps Engineers** need a hybrid skill set, combining knowledge from both Development and Operations, along with additional DevOps-specific skills.

### Core Responsibilities:

- **Commit Code**: Version control with Git, ensuring that changes are tracked and managed efficiently.
- **Package Management**: Tools like Gradle, Maven, and NPM are used for building and packaging applications.
- **Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD)**: Jenkins and GitLab automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform and Ansible automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration.
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker and Kubernetes manage containers and their orchestration, ensuring scalable and portable application environments.
- **Cloud Services**: AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud provide the infrastructure for deploying and managing applications in the cloud.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Tools like Prometheus and Grafana track system performance and health, ensuring applications run smoothly in production.

### DevOps Tools and Technologies:

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: The backbone of DevOps, automating the entire release process from code commit to deployment.
- **Automation**: DevOps replaces manual tasks with automated tools, reducing human error and speeding up the delivery process.

### High-Level Overview:

Throughout the bootcamp, you'll dive into each aspect of DevOps, gaining detailed knowledge and hands-on experience. By the end, you'll be able to implement and manage the entire DevOps process, from development to deployment, with efficiency and reliability.
